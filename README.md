# SSD-CHAT-APP
"This is a homework assignment by Oussama A. Belaiche, a CS student, focusing on building a chat app, covering real-time messaging, and UI design."

## Chat App

This repository contains a simple chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. The application allows users to log in with a predefined username, select a user to chat with, and exchange messages in real-time.

 Features

- User Authentication: Users can select a predefined username from a list to log in to the chat application.
- Real-Time Communication: Messages are exchanged in real-time using Socket.IO, allowing for instant communication between users.
- Message History: Previous messages are stored and displayed when a user logs in, ensuring that users can see past conversations.

 Installation

To run the chat application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Oussama-A-Belaiche/SSD-CHAT-APP
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd chat-app
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the chat application.

 Usage

- Upon accessing the application, users will be presented with a login page where they can select a predefined username.
- After logging in, users will be redirected to the chat room where they can exchange messages with other users.
- Messages are displayed in real-time, and previous messages are shown when users log in.

 Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development.
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js used for routing and middleware.
- Socket.IO: A library for real-time web applications that enables bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
